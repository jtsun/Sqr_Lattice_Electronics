# Square Lattice Electronic Properties
Here we study the electronic properties of a square lattice using Landauer formula and 
recurssive Green's function. Although a square lattice may not have practical use, the
development of the technique for this simple structure is insightful.
One can use the Landauer formula and write the system conductance in terms of the scattering
matric associated with the sample

Then transmission amplitude can be written in terms of system Green's function via Fisher-Lee 
relation to write
